# Classification

This project is a Data Mining coursework that uses the Adult dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to predict whether the income of an individual exceeds 50K per year based on 14 attributes. 

The first part of the coursework is to create a table with the number of instances, number of missing values, fraction of missing values over all attribute values, number of instances with missing values and fraction of instances with missing values over all instances. 

The second part of the coursework converts the attributes to nominal and prints the discrete values of each attribute.

The third part builds a decision tree for classifying and individual to one of the <=50k and > 50k categories and compute the error rate. 

The last part of this coursework trains two decision trees using two different approaches to handle missing values. The first way is to create a new value "missing" and the second method is by using the most popular value for all missing values of each attribute.
